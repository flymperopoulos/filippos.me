				<h3>Weather Balloon</h3>
				<p>4 Olin students and I decided to do a Passionate Pursuit (PP) this semester and launch a weather balloon. A PP is a side project that students can work on during a semester at Olin that is funded by the school. Our goal was to collect pictures of our wonderful home, Earth, from the Stratosphere and the height of 100,000 feet. It was an awesome experience; we managed to sent something to space and retrieve it!</p>

				<p>We started off by specing out materials, while focusing on the construction of the payload. As shown below, the payload was designed to provide space for a camera (GoPro), an RCLogger, a phone that would collect data on altitude, speed and finally, a gimble-like mechanism that oriented our GPS Tracker to always face upward and record data every 10 minutes.</p>

				<p>Once we ordered and received the appropriate parachute and balloon and equiped ourselves with a net and a helium tank, we were ready to set out for an adventure! We drove 3 hours west and launched from Nassau, NY. The trajectory we estimated, determined that the balloon was going to land close to Worcester. We performed some tests prior to our arrival at Nassau, making sure that all the instruments functioned properly.</p>

				<p>Given the weight of the paylod and the positive lift, we determimed a velocity of ascent of approximately 5m/s and a speed of descent around 19m/s.</p>

				<p>As we saw the balloon go, we used the GPS Tracker, as well as the Android device in the payload to keep track of the balloon's location. After tree hours we were able to track it down. The pictures captured were amazing! </p>
